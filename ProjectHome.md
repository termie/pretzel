Pretzel is a Jabber/XMPP server designed to be able to be easily extensible.

It is built on top of the Twisted and is designed to be a platform on top of which Jabber Extension Proposals can easily be implemented, in order to drive client adoption and testing.

Why Pretzel?
**the need for a scripty-language Jabber server** the Twisted framework is kind of pretzel-y
**the first big batch of code was committed in Stuttgart, Germany, birthplace of the pretzel**
